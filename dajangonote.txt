to create a new app => python manage.py startapp <your app name> => here we have 2 of them admin and user





db will be configured in settings.py
for now we dont need a lot of apps we need only one app and there inside urls.py we can define urls for separate separate fucntions for admin and users and separate one for login


migrations in django=>
when you define somthing in your models files then you need to perform a migration you dont need to define that in your db it will automatically create it  
 python manage.py makemigrations 
 python manage.py migrate

but if you have already things in your db and you just added that inyou django model then you need to make a fake migration that
python manage.py makemigrations 
python manage.py migrate --fake

post things :
python -m pip install Pillow      use this to install pillow for : 
    img = models.ImageField(upload_to='post_images/')   to use ImageField we have to install this.
